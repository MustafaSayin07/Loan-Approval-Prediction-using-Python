Loan Approval Prediction with Machine Learning Using Python
In the realm of finance, loan approval prediction is a critical task that involves evaluating
an applicant's eligibility for a loan. This process requires a detailed analysis of various factors such as the applicantâ€™s 
financial history, income, credit rating, employment status, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging historical loan data 
and applying machine learning algorithms, businesses can build robust models to accurately predict loan approvals for new applicants.
